This project is a full-fledged website that employs machine learning techniques to predict pregnancy risk factors based on various parameters. The website is built using Python's Django framework and utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide risk assessment for pregnant individuals.

Overview
The Pregnancy Risk Detection website is designed to offer a user-friendly interface for predicting potential risk factors associated with pregnancy. Users can input relevant data, and the system will leverage machine learning models to generate risk assessments.

Features
User Interface: Intuitive web interface for users to input necessary parameters.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict pregnancy risk factors based on input data.
Data Processing: Preprocesses and handles user-provided data for efficient prediction.
Results Display: Provides clear risk assessment results based on the machine learning model's output.
Tech Stack
Python: Programming language used for machine learning model development.
Django: Web framework utilized for website development.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Includes relevant algorithms for risk assessment (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, etc.).
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development for the website's user interface.
SQLite/PostgreSQL: Database management system for storing user data.
Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pregnancy-risk-detection.git
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database: python manage.py migrate
Run the development server: python manage.py runserver
Access the website locally: http://localhost:8000

Usage
Fill in the required information about the pregnancy parameters.
Submit the form to obtain a risk assessment based on the machine learning models.
Review the risk assessment results provided by the system.
